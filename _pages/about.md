Welcome to my website! :smile: Here you can explore a variety of my ongoing projects and repositories. 

Let me provide you with a more detailed introduction to who I am and what I bring to the table. My academic journey commenced with a dual degree in Mathematics and Economics from the University of Alberta, which equipped me with a solid foundation in problem-solving and a comprehensive understanding of the business realm. Additionally, I hold a master's degree in Statistics from the University of Victoria, where I collaborated with Dr. Xuekui Zhang on research in biostatistics. My expertise lies in utilizing statistical techniques, particularly machine learning, to analyze complex biological data and extract valuable scientific insights.

I am deeply passionate about the data-driven approach to addressing questions across various disciplines such as biology and business, as evidenced by the sample works posted here. I firmly believe in the transformative power of data science in our increasingly complex world, where effective analytical processes can lead us to new discoveries and actionable insights. I am convinced that our government, corporations, and research institutions can enhance their efficiency and profitability by leveraging these insights. I am looking forward for the opportunity to solve real-world problems and contribute to innovative projects in an innovative organization.
